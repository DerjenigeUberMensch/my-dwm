Fork of dwm
~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-
Implements basic features for the average day user (me) and IS a bit bloated compared to default dwm
Keybinds are personal preferance

| Requirements |
.-~-~-~-~-~-~-~.
Optional (requires some modifications):
pactl (can be changed)
brightnessctl (can be changed)
scrot (can be changed)
.******\_\_\_\_******.
| Xlib Installed |
.~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-.
.******\_\_******.
| Installation |
.-~-~-~-~-~-~-~.
Optional:
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).
Edit your ~/.bashrc to alias make clean install ex: alias ccmk="sudo make clean install"

    Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm:
       ._________________________.
       | sudo make clean install |
       .~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~.

| Running dwm |
.~-~-~-~-~-~-~.
Optional:
exec picom &

    Add the following line at the end your ~/.xinitrc to start the wm using startx:
        .__________.
        | exec dwm |
        .~-~-~-~-~-.

    In order to connect you WM to a specific display, make sure that
    the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

        DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm

    (This will start the WM on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

.******\_\_\_******.
| Configuration |
.~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~.
Configuration can be done by modifying config.def.h (base config)
However you can modify config.h alone, I would only recommend this for non-release personal projects.
and (re)compiling the source code.

Notes :3
You are intented to use the monocle layout over tiled/floating
